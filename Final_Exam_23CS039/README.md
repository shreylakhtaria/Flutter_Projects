# Final_Exam_23CS039
Simple Flutter app for the final exam (23CS039).

How it works: UI collects user input, app logic validates and saves state locally, then displays results and feedback.

Run: install Flutter, run `flutter pub get` then `flutter run`.

Structure: `lib/main.dart` (entry), `models/`, `widgets/`, `screens/`.
